However, in the interior of this domain, the inte-grand has discontinuities only where x becomes equal to a whole multiple of ±2πi, and the integral is thus equal to the sum of the integrals taken in a negative sense around these values.

 </p><p id="paragraph58"> </p><p id="paragraph59">1 </p><p id="paragraph60">This function is ﬁnite for all ﬁnite values of t, and allows itself to be developed in powers of tt as a very rapidly converging series. Since, for a value of s whose real part is greater than 1, log ζ(s) = −Plog(1 − p−s) remains ﬁnite, and since the same holds for the logarithms of the other factors of ξ(t), it follows that the function ξ(t) can only vanish if the imaginary partof t lies between12i and −12i. The number of roots of ξ(t) = 0, whose real parts lie between 0 and T is approximately </p><p id="paragraph61">\[ =   2 \frac{ T }{ \pi }  \log  \frac{ T }{ 2 _{ \pi }}  -  \frac{ T }{ 2 _{ \pi }}^{ ; }\]
 </p><p id="paragraph62">because the integralRd log ξ(t), taken in a positive sense around the region consisting of the values of t whose imaginary parts lie between12i and −12i and whose real parts lie between 0 and T , is (up to a fraction of the orderof magnitude of the quantity1T) equal toT logT2π− Ti; this integralhowever is equal to the number of roots of ξ(t) = 0 lying within in this region, multiplied by 2πi. One now ﬁnds indeed approximately this number of real roots within these limits, and it is very probable that all roots are real. Certainly one would wish for a stricter proof here; I have meanwhile temporarily put aside the search for this after some ﬂeeting futile attempts, as it appears unnecessary for the next objective of my investigation. </p><p id="paragraph63">If one denotes by α all the roots of the equation ξ(α) = 0, one can express log ξ(t) as </p><p id="paragraph64">ttPlog1 −αα+ log ξ(0); </p><p id="paragraph65">for, since the density of the roots of the quantity t grows with t only astlog2π, it follows that this expression converges and becomes for an inﬁnite tonly inﬁnite as t log t; thus it diﬀers from log ξ(t) by a function of tt, that for a ﬁnite t remains continuous and ﬁnite and, when divided by tt, becomes inﬁnitely small for inﬁnite t. This diﬀerence is consequently a constant, whose value can be determined through setting t = 0. </p><p id="paragraph66">With the assistance of these methods, the number of prime numbers that are smaller than x can now be determined. </p><p id="paragraph67">Let F (x) be equal to this number when x is not exactly equal to a prime number; but let it be greater by12when x is a prime number, so that, for any x at which there is a jump in the value in F (x), </p><p id="paragraph68">\[ F  ( ^{ x } )   =   F  ( ^{ x }  +   \mathrm{0 )}   + _{ 2 }  F  ( ^{ x }  -   \mathrm{0 )}   \vartriangleright \]

But also the increase and decrease in the density of the primes from place to place that is dependent on the periodic terms has already excited attention, without however any law governing this behaviour having been observed. In any future count it would be interesting to keep track of the inﬂuence of the individual periodic terms in the expression for the density of the prime numbers. A more regular behaviour than that of F (x) would be exhibited by the function f (x), which already in the ﬁrst hundred is seen very distinctly to agree on average with Li(x) + log ξ(0). </p></body></html>
